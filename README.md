# Prediction of radio-detectable AGN with Machine Learning pipeline

Jupyter notebook with example script to load and run prediction pipeline from Carvajal et al. (2023). Article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202245770 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11652 

Data and model files can be obtained from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10220009)

* `running_pred_pipeline.ipynb` contains a simple code to download the files and run the prediction pipeline on them.
* `global_variables.py` contains names and paths of files for running the code.
* `global_functions.py` contains a few functions to run each step of the prediction pipeline.
